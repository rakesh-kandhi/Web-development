# Advanced Concepts

React offers several advanced concepts and patterns that allow developers to build more complex and efficient applications.

## Higher-Order Components

Higher-order components (HOCs) are a design pattern in React that allows for code reuse by wrapping components with additional functionality.

## Render Props

Render props is a pattern in React where components receive a function as a prop, allowing them to share code and data with other components.

## Refs and DOM Manipulation

Refs in React provide a way to access and interact with DOM elements directly. They are often used for imperatively managing focus, text selection, or triggering imperative animations.

## Custom Hooks

Custom hooks are reusable functions that encapsulate common logic in React components. They allow for code reuse and provide a way to share stateful logic between components without using higher-order components or render props.
