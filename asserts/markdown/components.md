# Components and Props

Components are the building blocks of React applications, allowing UIs to be broken down into reusable pieces. Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.

## Creating Components

In React, components can be created using either functional components or class components.

## Functional Components

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX elements. They are simpler and easier to understand compared to class components.

## Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They have additional features such as state and lifecycle methods.

## Passing Props

Props (short for properties) allow data to be passed from parent components to child components. Props are immutable and are passed down the component tree.
