# Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React allows components to render different content based on certain conditions or states.

## Conditional Rendering in React

React provides various techniques for conditional rendering, including if statements, ternary operators, and logical && operators.

## If-else Conditions

Conditional rendering using if-else statements allows components to render different content based on the evaluation of a condition.

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator (`condition ? true : false`) is a concise way to perform conditional rendering in React components.

## Logical && Operator

The logical && operator can be used for conditional rendering in React, where the component renders only if the condition evaluates to true.
