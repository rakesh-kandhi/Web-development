# Context API

The Context API in React provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props through every level of the component tree.

## Using Context for State Management

Context can be used for state management in React applications by creating a context provider to hold the state and context consumers to access the state from any component within the provider's scope.

## Creating Context Providers and Consumers

Context providers are responsible for managing the state and making it available to consuming components. Context consumers subscribe to the context and receive updates when the state changes.
