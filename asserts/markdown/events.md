# Events Handling

Event handling in React allows components to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.

## Event Handling in React

React provides synthetic events that wrap native browser events and provide consistent behavior across different browsers.

## Synthetic Events

Synthetic events in React are similar to native DOM events but have some differences, such as cross-browser consistency and automatic event delegation.

## Binding Event Handlers

In React, event handlers should be bound to the component instance either by using arrow functions or by binding them explicitly in the constructor.

## Event Delegation

React encourages event delegation by attaching event listeners at a higher level in the component tree and letting events propagate down to child components.
