# Forms and Form Handling

Forms are a fundamental part of web applications, and React provides features for creating controlled and uncontrolled forms and handling form submission.

## Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

In React, forms can be controlled or uncontrolled. Controlled components store form data in the component's state, while uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to store form data.

## Form Submission in React

React provides ways to handle form submission, such as using the `onSubmit` event handler on the form element and accessing form data using refs or state.

## Form Validation

Form validation is essential for ensuring that user input meets certain criteria. React provides techniques for implementing form validation, such as using built-in HTML validation attributes or third-party libraries like Formik.

## Using Third-Party Libraries for Form Validation (e.g., Formik)

Formik is a popular form management library for React that simplifies form validation, handling form submission, and managing form state.
