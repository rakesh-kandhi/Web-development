# Lists and Keys

Lists and keys are essential concepts in React for rendering dynamic content and maintaining the stability of component instances.

## Rendering Lists in React

React provides methods for rendering lists of data efficiently, such as using the `map()` function to iterate over an array and render a list of elements.

## Using map() for Lists

The `map()` function in JavaScript is commonly used in React to iterate over an array and return a new array of React elements representing the list items.

## Keys in React

Keys are special attributes used by React to identify each child component or element in a list. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed.
