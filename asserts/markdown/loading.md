# Loading and Lazy Loading

Loading and lazy loading techniques in React help improve performance by loading data and components asynchronously and deferring the loading of non-essential resources.

## Loading Data Asynchronously

Loading data asynchronously allows React components to fetch data from an API or perform other tasks without blocking the main thread, improving perceived performance.

## Lazy Loading Components

Lazy loading is a technique where React components are loaded asynchronously, improving initial page load times by deferring the loading of non-essential components until they are needed.

## Code Splitting

Code splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack that allows React applications to split code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand, reducing the initial bundle size and improving load times.
