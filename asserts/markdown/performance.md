# Performance Optimization

Performance optimization is crucial for ensuring fast and responsive React applications, especially as they grow in complexity and size.

## Memoization

Memoization is a technique used to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

## React.memo

React.memo is a higher-order component provided by React that memoizes functional components, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the component's props remain the same.

## useMemo and useCallback Hooks

The useMemo and useCallback hooks are used to memoize the results of expensive computations and callback functions in functional components, respectively.

## Virtualization Techniques for Large Lists (e.g., react-virtualized)

Virtualization is a technique used to optimize rendering performance by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen. Libraries like react-virtualized help implement virtualized lists and grids efficiently.
