# Proxying and CORS

Proxying and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) are important concepts to consider when developing React applications that interact with external APIs.

## Proxying API Requests in Development

During development, React applications often make API requests to external servers. Proxying these requests allows developers to avoid CORS issues by routing requests through the development server.

## CORS and Its Implications

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict web page access to resources from different origins. Understanding CORS is crucial for handling API requests and responses in React applications.

## Dealing with CORS Issues

CORS issues can arise when React applications make requests to APIs hosted on different domains. Strategies for dealing with CORS issues include configuring CORS headers on the server, using server-side proxies, or using JSONP for cross-domain requests.
