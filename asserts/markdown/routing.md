# Routing

Routing in React allows for navigation between different components or pages within a single-page application (SPA) without a full page reload.

## Client-side Routing with React Router

React Router is a popular library for implementing client-side routing in React applications. It provides a declarative way to define routes and navigate between components.

## Nested Routes

React Router supports nested routes, allowing for hierarchical routing structures where components are nested within one another.

## Route Parameters

Route parameters allow React components to access dynamic segments of the URL, such as user IDs or product IDs, and use them to fetch data or render specific content.
