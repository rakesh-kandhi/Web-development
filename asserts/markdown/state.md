# State and Lifecycle

State and lifecycle methods are essential concepts in React for managing component data and responding to component lifecycle events.

## State Management in React

State is a JavaScript object used to store component data that may change over time. It allows components to manage their own data independently.

## Class-based Component State

In class components, state is managed using the `setState()` method. When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.

## Functional Component State with Hooks (useState)

With the introduction of hooks in React, functional components can now have state using the `useState` hook. It provides a simple way to manage state in functional components.

## Component Lifecycle Methods

React components have lifecycle methods that are executed at various points during the component's lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
