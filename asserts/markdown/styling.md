# Styling in React

Styling in React can be done using various techniques, including CSS files, inline styles, CSS modules, and styled-components.

## CSS Modules

CSS Modules allow for scoped CSS styling in React components by generating unique class names for each component, preventing style conflicts.

## Styled-components

Styled-components is a library for styling React components using tagged template literals. It allows developers to write CSS directly within their JavaScript code, making styling more encapsulated and reusable.

## Inline Styling

Inline styling in React involves directly applying styles to JSX elements using the `style` attribute. While it provides flexibility, it can make the code harder to maintain, especially for complex styles.

## Third-Party Styling Libraries

There are several third-party styling libraries available for React, such as Bootstrap, Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS, which provide pre-designed components and styling utilities.
