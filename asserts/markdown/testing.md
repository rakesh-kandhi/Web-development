# Testing React Applications

Testing is an integral part of the development process in React to ensure the reliability and quality of applications. React provides tools and libraries for writing unit tests and integration tests.

## Unit Testing with Jest

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. It is commonly used for writing unit tests for React components and utility functions.

## Testing Library (e.g., React Testing Library)

React Testing Library is a testing utility library for React that encourages writing tests that closely resemble how users interact with the application. It provides APIs for querying and interacting with React components in tests.

## Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing is a testing technique in React where snapshots of component render output are saved and compared against subsequent renders to detect unexpected changes in the UI.
